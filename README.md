## Read Me: About the Project!
'Waste Colonialism, Explained' is a scrollytelling project created by Sharon Chen and Shreya Thalvayapati for JRNL 5500.

Our code was heavily supported by a Professor Rahul Bhargave’s [Scrollytelling + Bootstrap Boilerplate](https://scrollama-with-bootstrap-boilerplate.glitch.me/),
and we took inspiration from the code of pudding.cool’s ‘[Easier scrollytelling with position sticky.](https://pudding.cool/process/scrollytelling-sticky/)’
